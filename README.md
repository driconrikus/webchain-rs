NOTE:

An offline wallet, also known as cold storage, provides the highest level of security for savings.
It involves storing a wallet in a secured place that is not connected to the network (air-gapped).
When done properly, it can offer a very good protection against computer vulnerabilities.
```

Distributed as a Rust crate or can be embedded via foreign function interface (FFI).

For minimalistic CLI tool refer to [Emerald Console](https://github.com/ETCDEVTeam/emerald-vault), or 
if you looking for a fully-featured UI wallet, take a look at our [Emerald Wallet](https://emeraldwallet.io)


## Features

### General

* Create and read Private Keys
* Compatible with Parity and Geth private key JSON files
* Import Private Key from Mnemonic Phrase
* Support of Ledger Nano hardware wallet 
* Transactions signing

## Installation

Ensure you have these dependencies installed:

```
openssl pkgconfig rustc cargo clang
```

`cargo` and `rustc` should be at least versions 0.18 and 1.17 respectively.

Should your distribution or operating system not have a recent `cargo` and `rustc` binaries, you can install them from: http://doc.crates.io/

```
$ cargo install emerald-cli
```

If you use [Nix](http://nixos.org/nix) you may execute the `nix-shell` command in your cloned repository and all dependencies will be made available in your environment automatically.

## Examples

```
extern crate emerald_core as emerald;

use std::net::SocketAddr;

fn main() {
    let addr = "127.0.0.1:1920"
        .parse::<SocketAddr>()
        .expect("Expect to parse address");

    emerald::start(&addr, None, None);
}
```
